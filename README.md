## About the API Project
In this project I am requested to design an API that will store EcoPower Logistics database in microsoft azure. 

## Requirements
Functional requirements refer to a system's functionality and how the functions should be performed. Non-functional requirements refer to the aspects of a solution that have an impact on the quality attributes of a system (or platform). These non-functional requirements are deemed as supportive requirements to ensure that the functional requirements are implemented appropriately and according to good software practices.

## API Endpoints
An API endpoint is a point at which an API -- the code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other -- connects with the software program. APIs work by sending requests for information from a web application or web server and receiving a response. (ex. below)

1. GET: Get List of products.
    - This endpoint allows you to fetch a list of products available in the catalog.
    - retrieve a list of available products in the catalog

2. GET: Get Product Details
    - This endpoint allows you to retrieve detailed information about a specific product.

3. POST: Create New Product
    - This endpoint allows you to add a new product to the catalog.

4. PUT: Update the product
    - Updates an existing reqource

5. DELETE: Removes product
    - Removes a resource
