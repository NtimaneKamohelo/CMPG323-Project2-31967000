## About the API Project
In this project I am requested to design an API that will store EcoPower Logistics database in microsoft azure. 

## Requirements
Functional requirements refer to a system's functionality and how the functions should be performed. Non-functional requirements refer to the aspects of a solution that have an impact on the quality attributes of a system (or platform). These non-functional requirements are deemed as supportive requirements to ensure that the functional requirements are implemented appropriately and according to good software practices.
